# CS 537: Introduction to Operating Systems

My study resources for CS 537 (Spring 2020, Professor Shivaram Venkataraman) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

## Three Easier Pieces

CS 537 is organized into three broad units that align with our [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) textbook. This repository's goal is not to repeat all of our textbook's information, but to compress it into several lightweight review documents.

1. Virtualization: mechanisms that enable multiple programs to share limited physical resources
2. Concurrency: mechanisms that orchestrate the access of shared resources among threads of a program
3. Persistence
